#function- is a set of code instructions labeld under
# a custom name that the computer will run
# function suntax (rules of how ita written)
# functions have 2 phases: function defenition and
# function call

# functiom definition
# we are describing the instruction for our custom code.
# we are adding logic to the computers vocabulary

def example ():
print  (good morning) # 1 instruction : print good morning 



# phase 2: function call
# once we have the definition, we can now run the instructions
# by writing the function name



# we indent to infroe the computer that we are about to write
# code instruction. if we dont we will get a error

def exampple():
    print (goodmorning)#1 instruction goodmorning


    # phase 2 

    a=input (enter a number)

















# creat a function that will calculate 2 numbers
# with different artithmetic operators
    def calculate ():
        numx input  (please enter a number
numy = input (please enter another number)
print (numx,numy)

calculate()
