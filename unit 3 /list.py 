#lists- A system for collecting and organizing multiple peices
# of data

# list syntax (how it is written)
# when we want to create a list, we first create a varaible name
# and assign it to the square brackets []
# we then put the data we want to collect  inside of 
# the square brackets

shoopingcart = {water', ice', ceral',apples'}



# Accesing items into a list-
#when we want to access an item ina list we write the variable name
# and then use the square brackets and pass in the item position in 
# the brackets 

# python is a zero-based index language. meaning ; when counting
# items, zero is treated as an actual number and is counted
