#operators are in construct (built in system) that give
#data types more actions and power
#trithmetic operator familly
#arithmetic operators are simply math operations 
print (2+4) #addition operator
print (10-10) # subtraction operator
print (2/1) #division operator
print (20.9*12.34) #mulitiplication operator
#assigment operator family 
#these operators assign vaules to
#variables (otherwise known as containers)
#key/vaule parts
schoolname=boys latin
age=16

print(age)
age+2=#adding a new value to our variable
age *=3 #multiplying a new vaule to our variable
print (age) 












#comparison operator family
#comparison family of operators simply compares values
print (2>1)
print (100<29)
# double equal signs mean
# its comparing if the values are the same


#logical operator family
# it checka and compares if certain code conditions 
# are true or false

print (3>1 and "jaquan"="jaquan") this will return true 
       # and the operator checks to see both conditions are true
       # if both are true the answer is true 
 #the or operator checks if one of the conditions is true 
 #so long as one of the conditiond is true, it will be true 
 # thr not operator will give the oposite result 
 #the not operator flips the result
